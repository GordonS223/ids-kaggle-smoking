# IDS Project - KAGGLE-SMOKING

## TODOs:
- Finish coding part
- Make structured .ipynb files and add all required files to the repositories / packages to the list at *How to replicate our code*
- Fulfill *Requirements about the code repository*
---

For the course Introduction to Data Science in Autumn 2023/24, we develop a classification model for the Kaggle competition [Binary Prediction of Smoker Status using Bio-Signals](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e24/).

Group members: Gordon Suhr, Luka Namoradze, Eva Urankar

## Content

- [Code](./Code.ipynb)
- [Homework 10](./F1_report.pdf)

## How to replicate our code

We developed our prediction models using Python in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment. To replicate our solutions, open and run our [Code](./Code.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook. To run all of the code, the following packages need to be installed (e. g. via `pip install`):
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- (...) **TODO: check which ones**

## (to be removed) Requirements about the code repository

These are taken from the project requirements slides:

- The front page must:
  - Present the name of the project and the authors
  - Provide the motivation and goal of the project
  - Provide a guide to the contents of the repository
- Explain how it is possible to take the code and replicate the same analysis that the authors have done
- The repository should contain enough explanations so that it is possible for an experienced programmer to understand what code is where and what different parts of code do.
- The repository can contain code for which the results are not presented at the poster. This can help us better assess the amount of work you have done.
