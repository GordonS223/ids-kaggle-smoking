# IDS Project - KAGGLE-SMOKING

For the course Introduction to Data Science in Autumn 2023/24 at the University of Tartu, we developed a classification model for the Kaggle competition [Binary Prediction of Smoker Status using Bio-Signals](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e24/).

Smoking remains a significant public health concern, impacting overall well-being and leading to various
health complications. Understanding smoking behavior through predictive modeling contributes to
tailored interventions and early detection of health risks.

The project aims to utilize bio-signals and health indicators to predict an individual's smoking status.

Group members: Gordon Suhr, Luka Namoradze, Eva Urankar

## Content

- Our Code is stored in a [Jupyter Notebook](./Code.ipynb) that includes explanations for every step
- The [data](./data) we worked on
- [Our submissions](./our_submissions/)
- [Other submissions](./top_submissions) that some of our ensemble methods are based on 
- The [CRISP-DM report](./F1_report.pdf) for Homework 10

## How to replicate our code

We developed our prediction models using Python in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment. To replicate our solutions, open and run our [Code](./Code.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook. To run all of the code, the following packages need to be installed (e. g. via `pip install`):
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
